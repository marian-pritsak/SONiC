# SONiC+ Extensions Infrastructure
## Motivation
The SONiC NOS was made with extendability in mind. This document focuses on making the process of extending SONiC as easy as possible.

The main building block of SONiC is Docker. We are going to leverage the existing Docker and Docker Hub infrastructure and build SONiC+ on top of it.

While Docker provides a tool for packaging an application and Docker Hub - for hosting it, it is not enough to just execute `docker pull` to make an application "look and feel" like a native SONiC application. SONiC+ aims at making the process of development and integration of 3-rd party applications with a native integration into SONiC. For that we need to provide SONiC+ with the hooks to connect every SONiC+ application with the SONiC native infrastructure, like access to CONIFG DB, SAI, CLI, REST APIs, logging, ISSU etc.
The next section provides a ilst of requirements for the SONiC+ infrastructure.

## Requirements
SONiC+ infrastructure must satisfy the requirements below to give the SONiC user the look and feel of the original SONiC image.
1. The application provider can build a SONiC+ docker without building SONiC image
2. User can download SONiC+ docker without building it
3. User can browse available SONiC+ docker
4. User can add a new SONiC+ docker repository
5. apt like utility to be provided in SONiC for managing SONiC+ dockers
6. CONFIG_DB integration - subscribe to CONFIG_DB
7. APPL_DB integration - write to APPLICATION_DB
8. ASIC_DB integration - SAI calls
9. Can provide a default configuration
10. Can start automatically after installation
11. Can be started automatically after a system reboot
12. Can perform a graceful shutdown/restart
13. Can restart upon config reload
14. Can write to SONiC log
15. Autogenerated CLI based on CONFIG_DB schema
16. Autogenerated REST API based on CONFIG_DB schema
17. Can verify a platform it's running on
18. Shares the SONiC network namespace
19. Must be built from the same base SONiC+ docker layer

The rest of the document provides with a means of satisfying those requirements.

## SONiC SDK docker
The process of providing a new SONiC+ application consists of two steps - building a SONiC+ docker and downloading and using it on a switch.
This section focuses on the first step.

SONiC has a set of libraries that provide us with tools for accessing configuration, calling SAI APIs, and logging (req. 6, 7, 8, 14).
Provided that there is a full blown development environment - sonic-buildimage, it is easy to build a new application that will use those libraries.
But there is no need to actually spend time and build the whole image just to compile a SONiC+ application (req. 1).

For that purpose, a SONiC SDK docker image is to be provided along with the SONiC image to give everyone an ability to set up a SONiC development environment in just seconds.
The required actions will be to pull the SDK image to the local machine
```
$ docker pull sonic/sonic-sdk:<release>
```
and use it as a base for the future SONiC+ docker's Dockerfile.
```
FROM sonic/sonic-sdk
```

The sonic-sdk docker has all the swss SDK libraries like:
* swss common
* sairedis
* etc.
Along with their -dev packages, and build packages like gcc, make, autotools etc.

## Managing SONiC+ dockers
TBD
## CONFIG_DB schema
Every SONiC+ application **MUST** provide a valid CONFIG_DB schema file `/schema.json` within it's Docker image.
Below is the table of the fields that are used to describe the CONFIG_DB schema:

Path | Type | Description | Value restriction
--- | --- | --- | ---
/name | string | Name of the application | Lowercase letters, numbers and underscores
/description | string | User friendly description
/keys | array | Array of keys' descriptions
/keys/{{index}}/name | string | Name of the application | Lowercase letters, numbers and underscores, must start with "{{/name.upper()}}_"
/keys/{{index}}/description | string | User friendly description
/keys/{{index}}/fields | array | Array of fields' descriptions
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/name | string | Name of the field | Lowercase letters, numbers and underscores
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/description | string | User friendly description
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/type | string | Type of the field | One of string,int,intrange,choice
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/optional | bool | Indicates if the field is optional | True or False, optional - default is False
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/intmin | int | Min integer value | Valid only if /keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/type is "intrange"
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/intmax | int | Max integer value | Valid only if /keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/type is "intrange"
/keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/choice_list | array | Array of choices | Array items are strings, valid only if /keys/{{index}}/fields/{{index}}/type is "choice"
/keys/global_fields | array | Global configuration fields
/global_fields/{{index}}/name | string | Name of the field | Lowercase letters, numbers and underscores
/global_fields/{{index}}/description | string | User friendly description
/global_fields/{{index}}/type | string | Type of the field | One of string,int,intrange,choice
/global_fields/{{index}}/optional | bool | Indicates if the field is optional | True or False, optional - default is False
/global_fields/{{index}}/intmin | int | Min integer value | Valid only if /global_fields/{{index}}/type is "intrange"
/global_fields/{{index}}/intmax | int | Max integer value | Valid only if /global_fields/{{index}}/type is "intrange"
/global_fields/{{index}}/choice_list | array | Array of choices | Array items are strings, valid only if /global_fields/{{index}}/type is "choice"

**TODO:** More fields types

## Systemd integration
Upon installation of SONiC+ application, a systemd service will be generated and enabled.
## Shared resources
TBD
## Shutdown notifications
TBD
## Autogenerated configuration interfaces
TBD
## Entrypoint
TBD
## Versioning
TBD
